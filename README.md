1. Build a constructor function called Employee with firstname, lastname and a function of fullname, which concatenates the first, last names.
Create 2 more instance from it and display fullname for them using the original function fullname.

2. Add a method to your Employee object using prototyping which returns your initials.

3. Use prototyping on prebuilt JS objects (in our case Array Object) and write a .reverseIt() function, if let's say it's not exist or not cross browser compatible.
Then use your cross browser compliant .reverseIt() on one of your instances you created in step 1.
